The program is designed to be user-friendly, with clear prompts and feedback messages guiding the user through each operation. This project demonstrates basic file handling, list and dictionary operations, and input/output interaction in Python. It's ideal for beginners who are learning Python and want to work on a practical project involving data management and project.
